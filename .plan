Search results from fenopy are now in, all went pretty smooth and it was a good move to make the SearchResult handle the dictionary instead of the search results controller. Also, turns out this entire time we'd been doing the rankings backwards. so now it's ordered correctly.
I wrote down my TODO before v1 release on a whieboard, and it fills it. Sigh. Gonna really put a dint in it this weekend.
I've spent some time thinking about the background processes, and now only actual downloads to your media library get them. 
Added a reload folder button, I think it's got a nice aesthetic and doesn't detract from the title, works too, magic.
New folder icons - looks much more polished now
Awesome, killed off that really annoying "what folder is this?" bug where your root folder could change to some random folder that you've visited before effectively killing your ability to navigate.
I was sitting at the giant whiteboard in my office talking to @dbgrandi about how to make the login screen awesome, and we spent a bit of time thinking about the kinds of metaphors that we're working with in put.io and he gave this amazing idea which is the current login background which is based off the torrent pieces grid that's normally used in clients. I've toyed before with core animation in Mixtapes but pulling this one off was a bit easier. I think its a great introduction to the app. I also fixed all the annoyances in setting up ( until now it required a restart after logging in) and on that subject I came up with a nice way to deal with logging out. I essentially ask them to to hit the home button, and instead of backgrounding we kill the app. Then it reloads naturally, I doubt that logging in and out is something people'll do a lot so this is useful.
I made a testflight for danger today, and it was the first build she'd ever used to actually work completely. I'm pumped.

unRARing possibly broke.
Put.IO broke and now only uses HTTPS. 
Support native m4v there's your simpsons support.
The sliding table view now lets you select all of the items, looks like I was off by a fence post error.
Transfers that failed are not shown, I had gone over the account limit a few times.
Accounts popover fixed positions, I think it might be prudent to make a function that does show from viewInRootView because I use the same code in artsy
Looks like file deletion isn't working anyymore
Still possible to break the navigation stack and replace the root view from home with something else. When that happens there's no way to go back.
Stores account name so we can say "welcome x" on the account popover
