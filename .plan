unRARing possibly broke.
Put.IO broke and now only uses HTTPS. 
Support native m4v there's your simpsons support.
The sliding table view now lets you select all of the items, looks like I was off by a fence post error.
Transfers that failed are not shown, I had gone over the account limit a few times.
Accounts popover fixed positions, I think it might be prudent to make a function that does show from viewInRootView because I use the same code in artsy
Looks like file deletion isn't working anyymore
Still possible to break the navigation stack and replace the root view from home with something else. When that happens there's no way to go back.
Stores account name so we can say "welcome x" on the account popover
